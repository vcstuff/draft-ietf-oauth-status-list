--- abstract

This specification defines status list data structures and processing rules for representing the status of tokens secured by JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) or CBOR Object Signing and Encryption(COSE), such as JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), CBOR Web Tokens (CWTs) and ISO mdoc.
The status list token data structures themselves are also represented as JWTs or CWTs.

# Introduction

Token formats secured by JOSE {{IANA.JOSE}} or COSE {{RFC9052}}, such as JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) {{RFC7519}}, CBOR Web Tokens (CWTs) {{RFC8392}} and ISO mdoc {{ISO.mdoc}}, have vast possible applications. Some of these applications can involve issuing a token whereby certain semantics about the token can change over time, which are important to be able to communicate to relying parties in an interoperable manner, such as whether the token is considered invalidated or suspended by its issuer.

This document defines a Status List and its representations in JSON and CBOR formats that describe the individual statuses of multiple Referenced Tokens, which themselves are JWTs or CWTs. The statuses of all Referenced Tokens are conveyed via a bit array in the Status List. Each Referenced Token is allocated an index during issuance that represents its position within this bit array. The value of the bit(s) at this index correspond to the Referenced Token's status. A Status List may either be provided by an endpoint or be signed and embedded into a Status List Token, whereas this document defines its representations in JWT and CWT. Status Lists may be composed for expressing a range of Status Types. This document defines basic Status Types for the most common use cases as well as an extensibility mechanism for custom Status Types. The document also defines how an issuer of a Referenced Token references a Status List (Token).

An example for the usage of a Status List is to manage the status of issued access tokens as defined in section 1.4 of {{RFC6749}}. Token Introspection {{RFC7662}} defines another way to determine the status of an issued access token, but it requires the party trying to validate an access tokens status to directly contact the token issuer, whereas the mechanism defined in this specification does not have this limitation.

Another possible use case for the Status List is to express the status of verifiable credentials (Referenced Tokens) issued by an Issuer in the Issuer-Holder-Verifier model {{SD-JWT.VC}}.
The following diagram depicts the basic conceptual relationship.

## Rationale

Revocation mechanisms are an essential part for most identity ecosystems. In the past, revocation of X.509 TLS certificates has been proven difficult. Traditional certificate revocation lists (CRLs) have limited scalability; Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) has additional privacy risks, since the client is leaking the requested website to a third party. OCSP stapling is addressing some of these problems at the cost of less up-to-date data. Modern approaches use accumulator-based revocation registries and Zero-Knowledge-Proofs to accommodate for this privacy gap, but face scalability issues again.

This specification seeks to find a balance between scalability, security, and privacy by minimizing the status information to mere bits (often a single bit) and compressing the resulting binary data. Thereby, a Status List may contain statuses of many thousands or millions Referenced Tokens while remaining as small as possible. Placing large amounts of Referenced Tokens into the same list also enables herd privacy relative to the Issuer.

This specification establishes the IANA "Status Mechanism Methods" registry for status mechanism and registers the members defined by this specification. Other specifications can register other members used for status retrieval.

## Design Considerations

The decisions taken in this specification aim to achieve the following design goals:

* the specification shall favor a simple and easy to understand concept
* the specification shall be easy, fast and secure to implement in all major programming languages
* the specification shall be optimized to support the most common use cases and avoid unnecessary complexity of corner cases
* the Status List shall scale up to millions of tokens to support large scale government or enterprise use cases
* the Status List shall enable caching policies and offline support
* the specification shall support JSON and CBOR based tokens
* the specification shall not specify key resolution or trust frameworks
* the specification shall design an extension point to convey information about the status of a token that can be re-used by other mechanisms

# Terminology

Issuer:
: An entity that issues the Referenced Token and provides the status information of the Referenced Token by serving a Status List Token on a public endpoint.

Relying Party:
: An entity that relies on the Status List to validate the status of the Referenced Token. Also known as Verifier.

Status List:
: An object in JSON or CBOR representation containing a bit array that lists the statuses of many Referenced Tokens.

Status List Token:
: A token in JWT or CWT representation that contains a cryptographically secured Status List.

Referenced Token:
: A cryptographically secured data structure which contains a reference to a Status List or Status List Token. It is RECOMMENDED to use JSON {{RFC8259}} or CBOR {{RFC8949}} for representation of the token and secure it using JSON Object Signing as defined in {{RFC7515}} or CBOR Object Signing and Encryption as defined in {{RFC9052}}. The information from the contained Status List may give a Relying Party additional information about up-to-date status of the Referenced Token.

# Status List {#status-list}

A Status List is a byte array that contains the statuses of many Referenced Tokens represented by one or multiple bits. A common representation of a Status List is composed by the following algorithm:

1. Each status of a Referenced Token MUST be represented with a bit-size of 1,2,4, or 8. Therefore up to 2,4,16, or 256 statuses for a Referenced Token are possible, depending on the bit-size. This limitation is intended to limit bit manipulation necessary to a single byte for every operation and thus keeping implementations simpler and less error prone.

2. The overall Status List is encoded as a byte array. Depending on the bit-size, each byte corresponds to 8/(#bit-size) statuses (8,4,2, or 1). The status of each Referenced Token is identified using the index that maps to one or more specific bits within the byte array. The index starts counting at 0 and ends with "size" - 1 (being the last valid entry). The bits within an array are counted from least significant bit "0" to the most significant bit ("7"). All bits of the byte array at a particular index are set to a status value.

3. The byte array is compressed using DEFLATE {{RFC1951}} with the ZLIB {{RFC1950}} data format. Implementations are RECOMMENDED to use the highest compression level available.

The following example illustrates a Status List that represents the statuses of 16 Referenced Tokens, requiring 16 bits (2 bytes) for the uncompressed byte array:

~~~ ascii-art

status[0] = 1
status[1] = 0
status[2] = 0
status[3] = 1
status[4] = 1
status[5] = 1
status[6] = 0
status[7] = 1
status[8] = 1
status[9] = 1
status[10] = 0
status[11] = 0
status[12] = 0
status[13] = 1
status[14] = 0
status[15] = 1

## Status List in JSON Format {#status-list-json}

This section defines the structure for a JSON-encoded Status List:

* `status_list`: REQUIRED. JSON Object that contains a Status List. The object contains exactly two claims:
   * `bits`: REQUIRED. JSON Integer specifying the number of bits per Referenced Token in the Status List (`lst`). The allowed values for `bits` are 1,2,4 and 8.
   * `lst`: REQUIRED. JSON String that contains the status values for all the Referenced Tokens it conveys statuses for. The value MUST be the base64url-encoded (as defined in Section 2 of {{RFC7515}}) Status List as specified in [](#status-list).

The following example illustrates the JSON representation of the Status List:

~~~~~~~~~~
{::include ./examples/status_list_encoding_json}
~~~~~~~~~~

## Status List in CBOR Format {#status-list-cbor}

This section defines the structure for a CBOR-encoded Status List:

* The `StatusList` structure is a map (Major Type 5) and defines the following entries:
  * `bits`: REQUIRED. Unsigned int (Major Type 0) that contains the number of bits per Referenced Token in the Status List. The allowed values for `bits` are 1, 2, 4 and 8.
  * `lst`: REQUIRED. Byte string (Major Type 2) that contains the Status List as specified in [](#status-list-json).

The following example illustrates the CBOR representation of the Status List:

~~~~~~~~~~
{::include ./examples/status_list_encoding_cbor}
~~~~~~~~~~

The following is the CBOR diagnostic output of the example above:

~~~~~~~~~~
{::include ./example/status_list_encoding_cbor_diag}
~~~~~~~~~~

# Status List Token {#status-list-token}

A Status List Token embeds the Status List into a token that is cryptographically signed and protects the integrity of the Status List. This allows for the Status List Token to be hosted by third parties or be transferred for offline use cases.

This section specifies Status List Tokens in JSON Web Token (JWT) and CBOR Web Token (CWT) format.

## Status List Token in JWT Format {#status-list-token-jwt}

The Status List Token MUST be encoded as a "JSON Web Token (JWT)" according to {{RFC7519}}.

The following content applies to the JWT Header:

* `typ`: REQUIRED. The JWT type MUST be `statuslist+jwt`.

The following content applies to the JWT Claims Set:

* `iss`: REQUIRED when also present in the Referenced Token. The `iss` (issuer) claim MUST specify a unique string identifier for the entity that issued the Status List Token. In the absence of an application profile specifying otherwise, compliant applications MUST compare issuer values using the Simple String Comparison method defined in Section 6.2.1 of {{RFC3986}}. The value MUST be equal to that of the `iss` claim contained within the Referenced Token.
* `sub`: REQUIRED. The `sub` (subject) claim MUST specify a unique string identifier for the Status List Token. The value MUST be equal to that of the `uri` claim contained in the `status_list` claim of the Referenced Token.
* `iat`: REQUIRED. The `iat` (issued at) claim MUST specify the time at which the Status List Token was issued.
* `exp`: OPTIONAL. The `exp` (expiration time) claim, if present, MUST specify the time at which the Status List Token is considered expired by its issuer.
* `ttl`: OPTIONAL. The `ttl` (time to live) claim, if present, MUST specify the maximum amount of time, in seconds, that the Status List Token can be cached by a consumer before a fresh copy SHOULD be retrieved. The value of the claim MUST be a positive number.
* `status_list`: REQUIRED. The `status_list` (status list) claim MUST specify the Status List conforming to the rules outlined in [](#status-list-json).

The following additional rules apply:

1. The JWT MAY contain other claims.

2. The JWT MUST be digitally signed using an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm. Relying parties MUST reject the JWT if it is using a Message Authentication Code (MAC) algorithm. Relying parties MUST reject JWTs with an invalid signature.

3. Relying parties MUST reject JWTs that are not valid in all other respects per "JSON Web Token (JWT)" {{RFC7519}}.

4. Application of additional restrictions and policy are at the discretion of the verifying party.

The following is a non-normative example for a Status List Token in JWT format:

~~~~~~~~~~
{::include ./examples/status_list_jwt}
~~~~~~~~~~

## Status List Token in CWT Format {#status-list-token-cwt}

The Status List Token MUST be encoded as a "CBOR Web Token (CWT)" according to {{RFC8392}}.

The following content applies to the CWT protected header:

* `16` TBD (type): REQUIRED. The type of the CWT MUST be `statuslist+cwt` as defined in {{CWT.typ}}.

The following content applies to the CWT Claims Set:

* `1` (issuer): REQUIRED. Same definition as `iss` claim in [](#status-list-token-jwt).
* `2` (subject): REQUIRED. Same definition as `sub` claim in [](#status-list-token-jwt).
* `6` (issued at): REQUIRED. Same definition as `iat` claim in [](#status-list-token-jwt).
* `4` (expiration time): OPTIONAL. Same definition as `exp` claim in [](#status-list-token-jwt).
* `65533` (time to live): OPTIONAL. Same definition as `ttl` claim in [](#status-list-token-jwt).
* `65534` (status list): REQUIRED. The status list claim MUST specify the Status List conforming to the rules outlined in [](#status-list-cbor).

The following additional rules apply:

1. The CWT MAY contain other claims.

2. The CWT MUST be digitally signed using an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm. Relying parties MUST reject the CWT if it is using a Message Authentication Code (MAC) algorithm. Relying parties MUST reject CWTs with an invalid signature.

3. Relying parties MUST reject CWTs that are not valid in all other respects per "CBOR Web Token (CWT)" {{RFC8392}}.

4. Application of additional restrictions and policy are at the discretion of the verifying party.

The following is a non-normative example for a Status List Token in CWT format (not including the type header yet):

~~~~~~~~~~
{::include ./examples/status_list_cwt}
~~~~~~~~~~

The following is the CBOR diagnostic output of the example above:

~~~~~~~~~~
{::include ./example/status_list_cwt_diag}
~~~~~~~~~~

# Referenced Token {#referenced-token}

## Status Claim {#status-claim}

By including a "status" claim in a Referenced Token, the Issuer is referencing a mechanism to retrieve status information about this Referenced Token. The claim contains members used to reference to a status list as defined in this specification. Other members of the "status" object may be defined by other specifications. This is analogous to "cnf" claim in Section 3.1 of {{RFC7800}} in which different authenticity confirmation methods can be included.

## Referenced Token in JWT Format {#referenced-token-jwt}

The Referenced Token MUST be encoded as a "JSON Web Token (JWT)" according to {{RFC7519}}.

The following content applies to the JWT Claims Set:

* `iss`: REQUIRED when also present in the Status List Token. The `iss` (issuer) claim MUST specify a unique string identifier for the entity that issued the Referenced Token. In the absence of an application profile specifying otherwise, compliant applications MUST compare issuer values using the Simple String Comparison method defined in Section 6.2.1 of {{RFC3986}}. The value MUST be equal to that of the `iss` claim contained within the referenced Status List Token.
* `status`: REQUIRED. The `status` (status) claim MUST specify a JSON Object that contains at least one reference to a status mechanism.
  * `status_list`: REQUIRED when the status list mechanism defined in this specification is used. It contains a reference to a Status List or Status List Token. The object contains exactly two claims:
    * `idx`: REQUIRED. The `idx` (index) claim MUST specify an Integer that represents the index to check for status information in the Status List for the current Referenced Token. The value of `idx` MUST be a non-negative number, containing a value of zero or greater.
    * `uri`: REQUIRED. The `uri` (URI) claim MUST specify a String value that identifies the Status List or Status List Token containing the status information for the Referenced Token. The value of `uri` MUST be a URI conforming to {{RFC3986}}.

Application of additional restrictions and policy are at the discretion of the verifying party.

The following is a non-normative example for a decoded header and payload of a Referenced Token:

~~~ ascii-art

{
  "alg": "ES256",
  "kid": "11"
}
.
{
  "iss": "https://example.com",
  "status": {
    "status_list": {
      "idx": 0,
      "uri": "https://example.com/statuslists/1"
    }
  }
}
~~~

## Referenced Token in CWT Format {#referenced-token-cwt}

The Referenced Token MUST be encoded as a "COSE Web Token (CWT)" object according to {{RFC8392}}.

The following content applies to the CWT Claims Set:

* `1` (issuer): REQUIRED. Same definition as `iss` claim in [](#referenced-token-jwt).
* `65535` (status): REQUIRED. The status claim is encoded as a `Status` CBOR structure and MUST include at least one data item that refers to a status mechanism. Each data item in the `Status` CBOR structure comprises a key-value pair, where the key must be a CBOR text string (Major Type 3) specifying the identifier of the status mechanism, and the corresponding value defines its contents. This specification defines the following data items:
  * `status_list` (status list): REQUIRED when the status list mechanism defined in this specification is used. It has the same definition as the `status_list` claim in [](#referenced-token-jwt) but MUST be encoded as a `StatusListInfo` CBOR structure with the following fields:
    * `idx`: REQUIRED. Same definition as `idx` claim in [](#referenced-token-jwt).
    * `uri`: REQUIRED. Same definition as `uri` claim in [](#referenced-token-jwt).

Application of additional restrictions and policy are at the discretion of the verifying party.

The following is a non-normative example for a decoded payload of a Referenced Token:

~~~ ascii-art

18(
    [
      / protected / << {
        / alg / 1: -7 / ES256 /
      } >>,
      / unprotected / {
        / kid / 4: h'3132' / '13' /
      },
      / payload / << {
        / iss    / 1: "https://example.com",
        / status / 65535: {
          "status_list": {
            "idx": 0,
            "uri": "https://example.com/statuslists/1"
          }
        }
      } >>,
      / signature / h'...'
    ]
  )
~~~

## Referenced Token in other COSE/CBOR Format {#referenced-token-cose}

The Referenced Token MUST be encoded as a `COSE_Sign1` or `COSE_Sign` CBOR structure as defined in "CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE)" {{RFC9052}}.

It is required to encode the status mechanisms referred to in the Referenced Token using the `Status` CBOR structure defined in [](#referenced-token-cwt).

It is RECOMMENDED to use `status` for the label of the field that contains the `Status` CBOR structure.

Application of additional restrictions and policy are at the discretion of the verifying party.

The following is a non-normative example for a decoded payload of a Referenced Token:

TBD: example

# Status Types {#status-types}

This document defines potential statuses of Referenced Tokens as Status Type values. If the Status List contains more than one bit per token (as defined by "bits" in the Status List), then the whole value of bits MUST describe one value. A Status List can not represent multiple statuses per Referenced Token.

The registry in this document describes the basic Status Type values required for the most common use cases.
Additional values may defined for particular use cases.

## Status Types Values

A status describes the state, mode, condition or stage of an entity that is described by the Status List. Status Types MUST be numeric values between 0 and 255.
Status types described by this specification comprise:

 - 0x00 - "VALID" - The status of the Token is valid, correct or legal.
 - 0x01 - "INVALID" - The status of the Token is revoked, annulled, taken back, recalled or cancelled. This state is irreversible.
 - 0x02 - "SUSPENDED" - The status of the Token is temporarily invalid, hanging, debarred from privilege. This state is reversible.

The issuer of the Status List MUST choose an adequate `bits` (bit size) to be able to describe the required Status Types for the application.

The processing rules for JWT or CWT precede any evaluation of a Referenced Token's status. For example, if a token is evaluated as being expired through the "exp" (Expiration Time) but also has a status of 0x00 ("VALID"), the token is considered expired.

# Verification and Processing

## Status List Request

To obtain the Status List or Status List Token, the Relying Party MUST send a HTTP GET request to the Status List Endpoint. Communication with the Status List Endpoint MUST utilize TLS. Which version(s) should be implemented will vary over time. A TLS server certificate check MUST be performed as defined in Section 5 and 6 of {{RFC6125}}.

The Relying Party SHOULD send the following Accept-Header to indicate the requested response type:

- "application/statuslist+json" for Status List in JSON format
- "application/statuslist+jwt" for Status List in JWT format
- "application/statuslist+cbor" for Status List in CBOR format
- "application/statuslist+cwt" for Status List in CWT format

If the Relying Party does not send an Accept Header, the response type is assumed to be known implicit or out-of-band.

## Status List Response

In the successful response, the Status List Provider MUST use the following content-type:

- "application/statuslist+json" for Status List in JSON format
- "application/statuslist+jwt" for Status List in JWT format
- "application/statuslist+cbor" for Status List in CBOR format
- "application/statuslist+cwt" for Status List in CWT format

In the case of "application/statuslist+json", the response MUST be of type JSON and follow the rules of [](#status-list-json).
In the case of "application/statuslist+jwt", the response MUST be of type JWT and follow the rules of [](#status-list-token-jwt).
In the case of "application/statuslist+cbor", the response MUST be of type CBOR and follow the rules of [](#status-list-cbor).
In the case of "application/statuslist+cwt", the response MUST be of type CWT and follow the rules of [](#status-list-token-cwt).

The HTTP response SHOULD use gzip Content-Encoding as defined in {{RFC9110}}.

## Caching

If caching is required (e.g., to enable the use of alternative mechanisms for hosting, like Content Delivery Networks), the control of the caching mechanism SHOULD be implemented using the standard HTTP Cache-Control as defined in {{RFC9111}}.

## Validation Rules

TBD

# Further Examples

## Status List Token with 2-Bit Status Values in JWT format

In this example, the Status List additionally includes the Status Type "SUSPENDED". As the Status Type value for "SUSPENDED" is 0x02 and does not fit into 1 bit, the "bits" is required to be 2.

This example Status List represents the status of 12 Referenced Tokens, requiring 24 bits (3 bytes) of status.

~~~ ascii-art

status[0] = 1
status[1] = 2
status[2] = 0
status[3] = 3
status[4] = 0
status[5] = 1
status[6] = 0
status[7] = 1
status[8] = 1
status[9] = 2
status[10] = 3
status[11] = 3

These bits are concatenated:

# Security Considerations {#Security}

## Correct decoding and parsing of the encoded status list
TODO elaborate on risks of incorrect parsing/decoding leading to erroneous status data

## Cached and Stale status lists

When consumers or verifiers of the Status List fetch the data, they need to be aware of its up-to-date status. The 'ttl' (time-to-live) claim
in the Status List Token provides one mechanism for setting a maximum cache time for the fetched data. This property permits distribution of
a status list to a CDN or other distribution mechanism while giving guidance to consumers of the status list on how often they need to fetch
a fresh copy of the status list even if that status list is not expired.

## Authorized access to the Status List {#security-authorization}
TODO elaborate on authorization mechanisms preventing misuse and profiling as described in privacy section

## History
TODO elaborate on status list only providing the up-to date/latest status, no historical data, may be provided by the underlying hosting architecture

# Privacy Considerations

## Limiting issuers observability of token verification {#privacy-issuer}

The main privacy consideration for a Status List, especially in the context of the Issuer-Holder-Verifier model {{SD-JWT.VC}}, is to prevent the Issuer from tracking the usage of the Referenced Token when the status is being checked. If an Issuer offers status information by referencing a specific token, this would enable him to create a profile for the issued token by correlating the date and identity of Relying Parties, that are requesting the status.

The Status List approaches these privacy implications by integrating the status information of many Referenced Tokens into the same list. Therefore, the Issuer does not learn for which Referenced Token the Relying Party is requesting the Status List. The privacy of the Holder is protected by the anonymity within the set of Referenced Tokens in the Status List, also called herd privacy. This limits the possibilities of tracking by the Issuer.

The herd privacy is depending on the number of entities within the Status List called its size. A larger size results in better privacy but also impacts the performance as more data has to be transferred to read the Status List.

## Malicious Issuers

A malicious Issuer could bypass the privacy benefits of the herd privacy by generating a unique Status List for every Referenced Token. By these means, he could maintain a mapping between Referenced Tokens and Status Lists and thus track the usage of Referenced Tokens by utilizing this mapping for the incoming requests. This malicious behaviour could be detected by Relying Parties that request large amounts of Referenced Tokens by comparing the number of different Status Lists and their sizes.

## Unobservability of Relying Parties {#privacy-relying-party}

Once the Relying Party receives the Referenced Token, this enables him to request the Status List to validate its status through the provided `uri` parameter and look up the corresponding `index`. However, the Relying Party may persistently store the `uri` and `index` of the Referenced Token to request the Status List again at a later time. By doing so regularly, the Relying Party may create a profile of the Referenced Token's validity status. This behaviour may be intended as a feature, e.g. for a KYC process that requires regular validity checks, but might also be abused in cases where this is not intended and unknown to the Holder, e.g. profiling the suspension of a driving license or checking the employment status of an employee credential.

This behaviour could be mitigated by:
- adding authorization rules to the Status List, see [](#security-authorization).
- regular re-issuance of the Referenced Token, see [](#implementation-lifecycle).

## Unlinkability

Colluding Issuers and a Relying Parties have the possibility to link two transactions, as the tuple of `uri` and `index` inside the Referenced Token are unique and therefore traceable data. By comparing the status claims of received Referenced Tokens, two colluding Relying Parties could determine that they have interacted with the same user or an Issuer could trace the usage of its issued Referenced Token by colluding with various Relying Parties. It is therefore recommended to use Status Lists for Referenced Token formats that have similar unlinkability properties.

To avoid privacy risks for colluding Relying Parties, it is RECOMMENDED that Issuers use batch issuance to issue multiple tokens, see [](#implementation-lifecycle).

To avoid further correlatable information by the values of `uri` and `index`, Issuers are RECOMMENDED to:

- choose non-sequential, pseudo-random or random indices
- use decoy or dead entries to obfuscate the real number of Referenced Tokens within a Status List
- choose to deploy and utilize multiple Status Lists simultaneously

## Third Party Hosting

TODO elaborate on increased privacy if the status list is hosted by a third party instead of the issuer reducing tracking possibilities
TODO evaluate definition of Status List Provider?
 An entity that hosts the Status List as a resource for potential Relying Parties. The Status List Provider may be the issuer of the Status List but may also be outsourced to a trusted third party.

# Implementation Considerations {#implementation}

## Token Lifecycle {#implementation-lifecycle}

The lifetime of a Status List (and the Status List Token) depends on the lifetime of its Referenced Tokens. Once all Referenced Tokens are expired, the Issuer may stop serving the Status List (and the Status List Token).

Referenced Tokens may be regularly re-issued to increase security or to mitigate linkability and prevent tracking by Relying Parties. In this case, every Referenced Token MUST have a fresh Status List entry.

Referenced Tokens may also be issued in batches, such that Holders can use individual tokens for every transaction. In this case, every Referenced Token MUST have a dedicated Status List entry. Revoking batch issued Referenced Tokens might reveal this correlation later on.
